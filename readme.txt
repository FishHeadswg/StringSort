String Sorts


MSD development notes:
As soon as I read about MSD and the way it creates bucket lists, I thought there must ways
to optimize it. I would have preferred to factor out the regression but that did not seem
practical in this case. Instead, I focused on applying Robert Sedgewick's optimization
to recurse over the same vector.
